## Monolith

### Monolith pro's

- simple to create
- simple to deploy

### Monolith cons's

- hard to keep the code clean
- layered archicture helps

## Micro service

### Microservice pro's

- scale

### Microservice cons's

- complex
- expensive

## Modular Monolith

### Modular Monolith pro's

- advantages of monolith - better maintainable
- well defined, loosely coupled modules
